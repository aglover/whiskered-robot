# Whiskered Robot 

Simple Node, Coffeescript, and jQuery Mobile template (plus deployment to Heroku). And connect-assets for Coffeescript includes. Uses Whiskers as template engine too.

## Installation 

Make sure you have a current version of Node. I recommend [NVM](http://thediscoblog.com/blog/2013/03/12/node-in-3-commands/). Then `cd` into the root of this project and type:

`$> npm install`

Next, make sure you have Coffeescript in your path -- just install it for your current installation of Node:

`$> sudo npm install -g coffee-script`

Then make sure you have Ruby & Foreman (what if you don't?) and then type:

`$> foreman start`

Boom. Done.
